## Goal

The goal of the game is to build up your village, build troops and raid other villages.

## Start

To start playing type the command !play. It will create a new village with 300 clay, 300 clay and 300 iron. It also comes with pre-built buildings that are required to play the game.

## Resources

Theres 3 key resources in the game:
-wood
-clay
-rion

You automatically gain all 3 of these resources at all times. The higher your timber camp, claypit or iron mine is the more resources do you get.

Aise from these resources theres also the population. Upgrading Buildings and recruiting units for your troops will increase your total population.

## Building

In order to build you first need to figure out what you wanna build. It is recommended to upgrade timber camp, claypit and ironmine a lot in the beginning to get more resources.

With the command !build building you can upgrade a building.

### The Buildings

Use the command !buildings to see all buildings and what they do.

## Recruiting

Once you have unlocked(Level 3 HQ) and built barracks you get access to units. You can recruit units by typing !recruit unitname amount. Keep in mind each unit has a value for attack and defense. You can find out more about units with the command !units.
